# Mars-Camera
A special camera is launched into Mars’ orbit to identify and label “points of interest”  (POI for short), which are essentially pattern files (smaller matrix), within the source  image file for scientific research. The camera produces black and white images in  varying resolutions in the form of large matrices with integer values between 0 and  255. You must create a program that is capable of reading a file containing such an  image and search it for any POI provided by the user through a file as well. Once a POI has been identified, you must mark it by inverting its values (make them negative  e.g. 155 becomes -155). Finally after all such POI’s have been found and marked,  output the entire matrix to a new file specified by user. Your program must adhere to the following guidelines:- a) Must be dynamic to allow for files of any size to be processed b) Store matrices using appropriate structs (with appropriate initialization functions) c) No memory leakage d) Allow user to choose multiple POI files to mark for a single source image file e) You can assume number of columns of the matrix is provided at the start of  the file (but no row count data) Bonus functionality: a) POIs may be rotated either 90, 180, or 270 degrees b) POIs may overlap c) Neither row nor column data is provided in the file

This was my 2nd semester project if you get the same project then you can take help from my code.
But Please dont forget to mention me.
Thanks
